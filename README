To try this application, you need to create a MySQL database called "shell_development".
This database is shared among all applications in this repository.

Then, either check out the "separated" branch, or the "together" branch.

In the "together" branch, simply start the server in the "shell" application with

- script/server -p 3000

In the "separated" branch, you have to start three Rails applications:

- shell: script/server -p 3000
- blog: script/server -p 4000
- comment: script/server -p 5000

In either case, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/blog_entries to get
a simple blog application. If there is no difference between the two, then it works :-)
