To try this application, either check out the "separated" branch, or the "together" branch.

In the "together" branch, simply start the server in the "shell" application with

- script/server -p 3000

In the "separated" branch, you have to start three Rails applications:

- shell: script/server -p 3000
- blog: script/server -p 4000
- comment: script/server -p 5000

In either case, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/blog_entries to get
a simple blog application.
